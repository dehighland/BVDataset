# Overview

This page describes and links to a dataset of 30 patients tested for bacterial vaginosis (BV). For each patient, we provide slide images of vaginal microbiota that have corresponding labels of clue cell status as determined by a physician alongside Amsel criteria test values and the patient's diagnosis.

# Data Collection

The data was collected by a physician at Catawba Women's Center in Hickory, North Carolina between August 2022 and February 2023. The physician targeted non-pregnant female patients who self-reported vaginal discharge but did not attempt self-treatment prior to assessment. After agreement to participate in the study, a few samples of the patient's discharge were collected to perform the Amsel criteria and to send out to an outside laboratory for a NuSwab test. Data was collected from 30 patients.

The epithelial cells of discharge samples were imaged with a Swiftcam 18 Megapixel camera attached to a Swift SW380T 40X-2500X at a power of 40x. Across 30 patients, 3,692 cell images were captured. These 3,692 cell images were subsequently cropped into 11,181 sub-images of individual vaginal flora and assigned a binary label of clue cell status by a physician.

pH values and Amsel whiff test results were also collected for each patient.
