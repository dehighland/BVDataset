A dataset containing Amsel criteria based diagnostic information for bacterial vaginosis (BV). This dataset contains data for 30 patients seen at Catawba Women's Center in Hickory, North Carolina between August 2022 and February 2023. Each patient has values for vaginal pH, results of the Amsel criteria whiff test, and the diagnostic decision. In addition, each patient also has a set of epithelial cell images with corresponding labels of clue cell status as determined by a physician.
